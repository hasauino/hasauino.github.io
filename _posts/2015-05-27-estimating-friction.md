In this post, I will share a project I worked on for the Advanced Control course during my master's at [AUS](https://www.aus.edu/).  Group members: 

- Ehab Al-Khatib,
- Wasim Al-masri,
- and myself.

## Description

The aim of the project is to first identify a mechanical-electrical system and design a controller based on the extracted model. The system in hand is a linear voice coil motor. The controller used is a PI controller for the position. Coulomb Friction is estimated using curve fitting against the actual system response. Since Coulomb friction is not constant, the second phase is to estimate it using a state observer. The value of the estimated friction is used to add a compensator to the PI controller.

(rubber band was added at the end to check compensator performance)



## 1- Deriving systemâ€™s dynamic equations

### A) Horizontally oriented

$$
\sum F_x = m ~a_x
$$

$$
m \ddot{x}=K_{F} i-F_{c}-B \dot{x}
$$


Where $$i(t)$$ is calculated from the input voltage $$v_a$$ using the model of the electrical part of the motor:

$$
v_a = R~i + L ~{di \over dt} + E_a
$$

$$
\dot{i} = {v_a - R~i + E_a \over L}
$$

$$
\dot{i} = { {v_a - R~i + K_{emf} ~\dot{x} } \over L}
$$

Where $$K_{emf}$$ is the back EMF constant, $$K_F$$ is the force constant, $$R$$ is the coil resistance and $$L$$ is the coil
inductance, which are all given in the motor datasheet.

### B) Vertically oriented (Experiments setup)

$$
\sum F_x = m ~a_x
$$


$$
 m ~\ddot{x} = mg - F_c - B ~\dot{x}
$$
