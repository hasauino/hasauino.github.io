<h2><strong> <i class="far fa-address-card"></i> Summary </strong></h2> 

I’m a Mechatronics Engineer and Software Developer with a strong foundation in robotics, embedded systems, and backend development.
I bring full-stack problem-solving skills, from low-level drivers to full-fledged web interfaces, DevOps, and CI pipelines.
My academic background includes a master’s in Mechatronics Engineering with a thesis on autonomous robotic exploration, and I’ve published research in top venues like IROS and SN Computer Science.
