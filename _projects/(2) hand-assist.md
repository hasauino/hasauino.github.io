## Description

In this project, I designed a wearable device which can be used to actuate hand fingers for patients  who lost hand motor functions. The device actuates three fingers: thumb, index, and middle fingers. It uses a cable-driven mechanism to flex the fingers, whereas finger extension is achieved passively using elastic rubber bands.

### Design Overview

The design is compact consisting of a single unit weighing around 600 g (including the battery). The device height is around 4 cm measured from the forearm. It consists of a fabric glove, three linear actuators, a controller, a rechargeable battery, elastic rubber bands, tendon cables, and cable tubings (bowden tubes), as shown below:

### Glove Design

The glove is custom-made, it is used to connect the five tendon
cables to the palmar side of hand fingers. cable 1 is connected to actuator
1 from one end, and to the center of the proximal phalanx
(PP) of the thumb from the other end. Cable 2 and 3 are
connected to actuator 2 from one end, and to the centers
of the intermediate phalanges (IPs) of the index and middle
fingers from the other end. Cable 4 and 5 are connected to
actuator 3 from one end, and to the centers of the distal
phalanges (DPs) of the index and middle fingers from the
other end. To reduce glove deformation during the pulling
action of the actuators, inextensible fabric is used at each
finger-cable connection.
