## Description

In this project, I worked on designing a small-scale concrete 3D printer. This printer serves as a platform for testing different concrete mixtures. This is a joint project between Departement of Civil Engineering and Departement of Information Technology. Printer dimensions are 174x155 cm2. Printing area is 100x110 cm2. This project is still under progress, we still have to design the nozzle and extrusion mechanism.
