In this side project I developed an Uber-like app but for public transportation. It allows passengers to see when a bus will arrive and help them navigate using buses. More importantly, it helps bus drivers to see passengers who want to ride. This is only needed in countries where buses are operated by private owners, which is the case in jordan where I come from.

:construction: It is still a WIPâ€‹ 

The buses you see in the demo app below are bots running in the server. Device location is overriden to match where these bots are operating.

Soon will be released for iOS and Android :crossed_fingers:
